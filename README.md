# COSPAS/SARSAT automated commissioning scripts
A repository of commissioning scripts that can be run to test COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centers

# Purpose
The aim of this project is to provide a centralized version of MCC commissioning tests that can be run quickly and with a minimized human-in-the-loop element, which should drastically reduce commissioning time, effort, and pain due to the complexity in preparing and running tests by hand, the time it takes to resolve issues when there are test failures due to manual error, configuration error, test definition error, test result expectation error, etc. All MCCs will also have access to the scripts at any point in time so they can understand the requirements they must meet.
